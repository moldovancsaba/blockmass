# WARP.DEV_AI_CONVERSATION

Author: AI (Agent Mode)

Plan Recorded:
- Implemented core foundation files (db connector, metrics, socket health, dashboard UI)
- Added admin health API aggregator
- Replaced README and created RELEASE_NOTES entry (v0.1.0)
- Added version automation scripts (predev patch bump; minor/major commands) and sync to docs/env
- Created governance docs: ROADMAP.md, TASKLIST.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, LEARNINGS.md

Dependencies and Considerations:
- MONGO_URI required in .env.local
- Version sync writes NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION (UI-safe) to .env.local
- No tests per policy; no breadcrumbs in UI

Next Actions:
- Implement heartbeat mode and admin metrics endpoints
- Prepare GitHub and Vercel deployment per release rules

Update 2025-09-26T10:44:44.000Z (UTC):
- Delivered heartbeat endpoint (POST /api/health/heartbeat) with TTL-based active count
- Delivered public health endpoint (GET /api/health/public)
- Delivered admin metrics endpoint (GET /api/health/metrics) with X-Admin-Token protection
- Added env/auth/logger utilities and HealthPing/SocketStat models

Update 2025-09-27T10:12:29.071Z (UTC):
- Plan: enable root-level build/dev by delegating to ./frontend
- Actions: created root package.json with delegated scripts; fixed frontend/package.json private flag; updated README quickstart
- Rationale: reuse existing Next.js app in ./frontend; minimal non-invasive change; comply with Reuse-Before-Creation and logging rules

Update 2025-09-27T10:41:02.404Z (UTC):
- Fixed duplicate homepage route warning by removing frontend/app/page.js and keeping page.jsx (the functional home)
- Verified with npm run build from repo root — build succeeds, no duplicate warnings
- Logged learnings and rationale; no dependencies added

Update 2025-09-27T10:46:40.975Z (UTC):
- Fixed MongoDB env var mismatch by supporting both MONGO_URI and MONGODB_URI in db connector
- Improved homepage socket metrics to connect first and poll health periodically so counts update
- Scaffolded env example (includes both keys) and confirmed setup script behaviour
- No secrets exposed in outputs; .env.local remains local-only

Update 2025-09-27T11:06:39.817Z (UTC):
- Suppressed npm funding message by adding .npmrc with fund=false at repo root and ./frontend
- Verified npm install shows no funding prompt; builds remain clean and dependency-safe

Update 2025-09-27T12:18:29.407Z (UTC):
- Upgraded UI states: loading, success, warning, and error visuals
- StatusCard gained variant-aware styling and optional note
- Homepage shows friendly Mongo and Socket status instead of raw JSON
- Admin dashboard cards now signal health with success/warning/error variants

Update 2025-09-27T13:11:17.422Z (UTC):
- Enforced strict high-contrast rule:
  - BLACK text on WHITE background by default
  - WHITE text on BLACK background for error emphasis
- Removed all tinted backgrounds; borders and dots now use only black/white
- Verified clean build

Update 2025-09-28T08:27:26.000Z (UTC):
- Added native JSON-RPC provider (server-only) at app/_lib/chain.js (no new libraries)
- New API endpoint GET /api/chain (Node runtime) returning chain health summary
- Health Dashboard updated to include Chain status card
- Docs updated: README (Blockchain Mode), ROADMAP, TASKLIST, ARCHITECTURE, RELEASE_NOTES (v0.3.0)
- Env required: CHAIN_RPC_URL, CHAIN_ID, CHAIN_EXPLORER (server-only)
- Next steps: JSON-RPC event sampling, optional MongoDB indexing, minimal wallet connect (EIP-1193)

Update 2025-09-28T09:30:05.000Z (UTC):
- Created .env.example with CHAIN_* keys and sample ERC20 defaults (DAI mainnet)
- Extended chain provider: eth_call helper and ERC20 totalSupply reader (no new libraries)
- Health Dashboard now shows sample ERC20 address and formatted totalSupply when CHAIN_SAMPLE_ERC20 is set
- Updated README, ARCHITECTURE, RELEASE_NOTES to document the optional ERC20 demo

Update 2025-09-30T08:44:31.085Z (UTC):
- Added WARP.md at repo root with commands, env, architecture, governance guidance for Warp
- Bumped MINOR to v0.4.0 and synced docs/env via scripts (bump-version, sync-version)
- ROADMAP and TASKLIST updated to include WARP onboarding maintenance

Update 2025-09-30T11:16:01.000Z (UTC):
- Standardized DB env to MONGODB_URI (removed MONGO_URI fallback); updated db.js and all docs/examples
- Removed duplicate app/page.js (kept app/page.jsx) to avoid default route collision
- Implemented real Socket.IO server as a singleton in pages/api/socketio.js (Node runtime), with metrics broadcasts
- Updated homepage (app/page.jsx) to consume real-time metrics via socket.io-client
- Added __MACOSX/ to .gitignore (root and frontend)
- Updated frontend/.env.example to include MONGODB_URI default and clarified comments
- Clarified next.config.mjs comments to reflect project directory root
- README/WARP updated: MONGODB_URI + ADMIN_API_TOKEN required, Vercel instructions noted

Update 2025-09-30T12:02:59.512Z (UTC):
- Bumped MINOR to v0.5.0 and synced docs/env via scripts; added v0.5.0 release notes (docs + Socket.IO + env standardization)
- Build verified post-bump; dev smoke intentionally skipped to preserve v0.5.0 (predev bumps PATCH to v0.5.1).

Update 2025-09-30T14:32:34.836Z (UTC):
- Chain health updated to sequential JSON-RPC calls with tiny delay to avoid Cloudflare “Cannot fulfill request” (-32046)
- Version bumped to v0.6.0; release notes updated

Update 2025-09-30T14:49:40.812Z (UTC):
- Added retry with jittered backoff for transient RPC errors (-32046/-32603/HTTP 429/5xx) in core RPC helper
- Version bumped to v0.7.0; release notes updated

Update 2025-09-30T15:00:41.000Z (UTC):
- Implemented multi-endpoint RPC fallback (CHAIN_RPC_URLS) and optional serialization (CHAIN_RPC_SERIALIZE) in app/_lib/chain.js
- Updated README, ARCHITECTURE, WARP.md, and .env.example to document new env keys and behaviour
- Rationale: Cloudflare occasionally returns -32046 "Cannot fulfill request"; fallbacks and single-flight queue improve reliability without adding deps
