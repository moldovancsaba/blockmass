## The Problem

### Traditional Cryptocurrency Mining
- **Expensive Hardware:** ASICs and GPUs cost thousands of dollars
- **High Energy Costs:** Mining Bitcoin uses more electricity than entire countries
- **Geographic Barriers:** Access to cheap electricity determines profitability
- **Technical Complexity:** Requires specialized knowledge to set up and maintain
- **Wealth Concentration:** Only the rich can afford to mine at scale

### Result
**Cryptocurrency has become exclusive to a privileged few, contradicting its original promise of financial democratization.**

---

## The Solution: STEP

### Core Innovation
Replace computational proof-of-work with **physical proof-of-location**:
- Mine by walking, not by burning electricity
- Smartphone replaces $10,000 ASIC
- Geographic location becomes the mining resource
- Everyone, everywhere has equal opportunity

### Universal Declaration of Human Rights

**Article 23:**  
*"Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment."*

*"Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work."*

**STEP Implements This:**
- Person in Myanmar = Person in Manhattan
- Same smartphone = Same mining power
- Same triangle = Same reward
- No discrimination based on wealth or location

---

## Mission Statement

**Democratize cryptocurrency mining by removing all barriers to entry, giving everyone—regardless of location or economic status—the opportunity to earn through physical presence.**

### Core Principles

1. **Zero Entry Cost**
   - No expensive hardware required
   - No electricity costs
   - No technical knowledge needed
   - Just a smartphone and the will to move

2. **Geographic Equality**
   - Mining in rural Myanmar earns same as Manhattan
   - Earth divided into 2.8 trillion equal triangles
   - Location diversity is strength, not weakness
   - Global mesh ensures fairness

3. **Proactive Passive Income**
   - **Proactive:** You must move, take action, be present
   - **Passive:** Earn while doing daily activities
   - **Real:** Tokens with actual utility and value
   - **Accessible:** Anyone can start today

4. **Physical Proof**
   - Real-world presence cannot be faked at scale
   - GPS + sensors verify authentic human movement
   - Anti-spoof heuristics catch automated attacks
   - Future: Hardware attestation for absolute proof

## How It Works

### For Users (B2C)

#### Basic Mining
1. Download mobile app
2. Walk anywhere on Earth
3. Mine triangles you visit
4. Earn STEP tokens
5. Convert to money or hold

**No hardware. No investment. No technical knowledge.**

#### Pathfinders Program
**Companies hire you to visit specific locations:**
- Restaurant chains: Verify menu displays ($10 + triangle rewards)
- Retailers: Check product availability and pricing
- Tourism: Document landmark conditions
- Real estate: Verify property photos match reality
- Market research: Survey local businesses

**Example:**  
Starbucks pays you $5 + triangle rewards to photograph their menu board and verify WiFi works at 20 locations. You earn tokens AND cash.

#### Hidden Gems
**Find sponsored collectibles in the real world:**
- "Coke Zero coupon hidden in Times Square triangle"
- "Nike NFT at flagship store entrance"
- "Free coffee for first 100 miners at this location"
- Scavenger hunts with branded rewards

**Example:**  
McDonald's places 1 million "Free Big Mac" coupons in triangles near their restaurants worldwide. Users hunt for gems while walking.

### For Businesses (B2B)

#### 1. Drive Foot Traffic
**Problem:** Traditional advertising can't guarantee store visits  
**Solution:** Boost triangle rewards near your location

**Example:**  
Mall increases mining rewards 10x during off-peak hours. Miners flood in, discover stores, make purchases. ROI is measurable and transparent.

#### 2. Market Research at Scale
**Problem:** Expensive mystery shoppers, slow data collection  
**Solution:** Pathfinders program with crowdsourced validation

**Example:**  
Retail chain pays pathfinders to verify 10,000 store displays nationwide in 24 hours. Cost: 1/10th of traditional mystery shopping. Speed: 100x faster.

#### 3. Customer Acquisition
**Problem:** Social media ads have unclear ROI  
**Solution:** Pay only for verified physical visits

**Example:**  
Car dealership pays $20 per miner who visits showroom. Track conversions, measure ROI, optimize spend. No more wasted ad budget on bots.

#### 4. Triangle Ownership
**Problem:** Can't own digital representation of physical space  
**Solution:** Buy mining rights to triangles

**Example:**  
Nike buys 10,000 triangles around flagship stores. Earns fee from every mine. Creates exclusive drops for triangle holders. Builds brand loyalty through location ownership.

## Economic Model

### Token Distribution

**Total Supply:** 7.7 trillion STEP tokens

**Distribution:**
- **Mining Rewards:** 100% distributed through proof-of-location
- **No pre-mine:** No team tokens, no VC allocation
- **No ICO:** Earn by moving, not by buying
- **Fair launch:** Everyone starts at zero

### Reward Formula

```
reward(level) = 1 / 2^(level - 1) STEP
```

**Examples:**
- Level 1 (continent): 1.000000 STEP
- Level 5 (country): 0.062500 STEP
- Level 10 (city): 0.001953 STEP
- Level 15 (street): 0.000061 STEP
- Level 21 (meter): 0.000001 STEP

**Subdivision:**
- Each triangle allows 11 proofs
- After 11th proof, subdivides into 4 children
- Children are one level deeper (smaller, less reward)
- Creates natural scarcity and discovery incentive

### Revenue Model

**Phase 2-3:** Bootstrap ecosystem
- Focus on user growth
- Free mining for all
- Build network effects

**Phase 4-5:** B2B monetization
1. **Pathfinders Marketplace** (30% commission)
2. **Triangle Sales** (listing fees + transaction fees)
3. **Hidden Gems** (placement fees + impression metrics)
4. **POI Sponsorship** (subscription + performance fees)
5. **API Access** (enterprise data access)

**Projected Revenue (Phase 5):**
- 10M active users × $5/month average = $50M/month
- 100K business customers × $500/month = $50M/month
- **Total:** ~$1.2B annually (conservative estimate)
