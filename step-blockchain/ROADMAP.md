2. Subdivision implementation
3. Performance optimization
4. Security hardening

**Medium Priority:**
1. Code organization (monorepo?)
2. Test coverage (manual â†’ automated)
3. API versioning
4. Error handling improvements

**Low Priority:**
1. UI/UX polish
2. Documentation improvements
3. Developer tooling
4. Analytics dashboard
