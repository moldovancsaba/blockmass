# Phase: Click-Based Spherical Triangle Visualization

**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Version:** Ready for Testing  
**Status:** Implementation Complete, Awaiting Device Testing

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement full 3D spherical mesh visualization showing mining progress across the entire planet using color gradients based on triangle click counts (0-10 clicks).

---

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `/step-blockchain/api/mesh.ts`

Added new `GET /mesh/active` endpoint that:
- Queries MongoDB for all active triangles at a given level with clicks > 0
- Returns triangle data with click counts, state, centroid, and optional polygon geometry
- Supports filtering by level, max results (default 512), and polygon inclusion
- Uses efficient MongoDB lean() queries for performance

**Usage:**
```
GET /mesh/active?level=10&maxResults=512&includePolygon=true
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "level": 10,
    "count": 156,
    "triangles": [
      {
        "triangleId": "STEP-TRI-v1:...",
        "clicks": 7,
        "state": "partially_mined",
        "centroid": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [lon, lat] },
        "polygon": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [...] }
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Mobile Type Definitions
**File:** `/step-mobile/src/types/index.ts`

Updated `Triangle` interface to include:
- `clicks?: number` - Number of successful mines (0-10 before subdivision)
- `state?: string` - Triangle state (pending, active, partially_mined, exhausted, subdivided)

---

### 3. useActiveTriangles Hook
**File:** `/step-mobile/src/hooks/useActiveTriangles.ts`

Created React hook that:
- Fetches all active spherical triangles at a given level from backend
- Returns triangles with click counts, loading state, error state
- Exposes `refetch()` function for manual refresh after mining
- Supports optional auto-refresh interval (disabled by default)
- Uses same API_BASE_URL logic as mesh-client.ts for consistency

**Usage:**
```tsx
const { triangles, loading, error, refetch } = useActiveTriangles(10, 512, true, 0);
```

---

### 4. Color Gradient Utilities
**File:** `/step-mobile/src/lib/triangle-colors.ts`

Created comprehensive color system for SPHERICAL triangles:

**Color Progression:**
- 0 clicks: `#0066CC` (Deep Blue) - Fresh, unmined
- 1-3 clicks: Blue â†’ Cyan - Early mining
- 4-6 clicks: Cyan â†’ Yellow - Mid mining
- 7-9 clicks: Yellow â†’ Orange - Late mining
- 10 clicks: `#FF3300` (Bright Red) - Fully mined, ready to subdivide

**Functions:**
- `getTriangleColor(clicks)` - Returns hex color based on click count
- `getCurrentTriangleColor()` - Bright red for user's position
- `getNeighborTriangleColor()` - Bright green for adjacent triangles
- `getTriangleOpacity(isFacingCamera, distance?)` - Handles backface culling and LOD
- `getTriangleMaterialProps(clicks, isCurrent, isNeighbor, isFacingCamera)` - Returns complete Three.js material properties

**Why this gradient:**
- Blue/cold colors = low activity
- Yellow/warm colors = moderate activity
- Red/hot colors = high activity, imminent subdivision
- Matches human intuition about "heat" = "activity"

---

### 5. RawEarthMesh3D Integration
**File:** `/step-mobile/src/components/earth/RawEarthMesh3D.tsx`

Updated 3D visualization component to:

**Render three triangle types:**
1. **Current triangle** (user's position):
   - Bright red, high emissive intensity
   - 5x geodesic subdivision (smooth curvature)
   - Always visible, highest priority

2. **Neighbor triangles** (adjacent to user):
   - Bright green, medium emissive intensity
   - 3x geodesic subdivision (moderate detail)
   - Help user understand spatial relationships

3. **Active triangles** (global mesh):
   - Color gradient based on click count (0-10)
   - 2x geodesic subdivision (performance optimization)
   - Skip triangles already rendered as current/neighbor
   - Limited to 512 triangles (matches frontend POC rule)

**New features:**
- Fetches active triangles via `useActiveTriangles` hook
- Converts GeoJSON polygon coordinates to Three.js Vector3 vertices
- Applies click-based colors using `getTriangleMaterialProps()`
- Exposes `onRefetchActiveReady` callback for parent components
- All triangles are SPHERICAL (vertices on sphere surface at radius 0.9999)
- Efficient LOD with lower subdivision for distant triangles

---

### 6. MapScreen Integration
**File:** `/step-mobile/src/screens/MapScreen.tsx`

Updated main mining screen to:
- Store `refetchActiveFnRef` reference for active triangle refresh
- Pass `onRefetchActiveReady` callback to `RawEarthMesh3D`
- Call `refetchActiveFnRef.current()` after successful mining
- Updates triangle colors immediately after mining completes

**Why this matters:**
- User sees instant visual feedback after mining
- Triangle color progresses from blue â†’ yellow â†’ red as clicks increase
- Provides intuitive understanding of mining progress

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

### Color Scheme
```
0 clicks  â†’  #0066CC (Blue)
3 clicks  â†’  #00CCCC (Cyan)
5 clicks  â†’  #FFFF00 (Yellow)
7 clicks  â†’  #FFAA33 (Orange)
10 clicks â†’  #FF3300 (Red)
```

### Triangle Priorities
```
Current:   Red    (100% emissive, 5x subdivision)
Neighbors: Green  (80% emissive, 3x subdivision)
Active:    Gradient (30% emissive, 2x subdivision)
Earth:     Dark Blue (#001133 at radius 0.998)
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Max 512 visible triangles (frontend POC rule)
- Lower subdivision for distant triangles (2x vs 5x)
- Backface culling via opacity (invisible when facing away)
- Skip triangles already rendered (deduplication)
- Efficient BufferGeometry with geodesic subdivision

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Spherical Triangle Rendering
All triangles are SPHERICAL, not flat:
- Vertices are 3D points on sphere surface at radius 0.9999
- Geodesic subdivision creates smooth curvature following sphere
- Recursive midpoint projection ensures accurate spherical geometry
- Three.js renders flat triangles between subdivided vertices

### Data Flow
```
Backend MongoDB
  â†“ (clicks, state)
/mesh/active API
  â†“ (JSON)
useActiveTriangles hook
  â†“ (Triangle[])
RawEarthMesh3D component
  â†“ (converts to Vector3)
Three.js BufferGeometry
  â†“ (renders)
WebGL via expo-gl
```

### Backend Query
```typescript
Triangle.find({
  level: 10,
  state: { $in: ['active', 'partially_mined'] },
  clicks: { $gt: 0 }
})
.select('_id clicks state centroid polygon')
.limit(512)
.lean()
```

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### Testing (Final Todo)
1. **Restart backend** to load new `/mesh/active` endpoint
2. **Test on device** with Expo:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Verify rendering:**
   - Current triangle = bright red
   - Neighbors = bright green
   - Active triangles = color gradient (blue â†’ yellow â†’ red)
   - Smooth rotation and zoom
   - 30+ fps performance

4. **Test mining workflow:**
   - Mine a triangle successfully
   - Observe triangle color update (clicks increase)
   - Verify refetch after mining updates visualization
   - Check performance remains smooth with more triangles

### Performance Validation
- Monitor frame rate (should stay at 30+ fps)
- Check memory usage with 512 triangles
- Verify smooth touch interactions (drag, pinch zoom)
- Test backface culling (triangles disappear when facing away)

### Visual Validation
- Color gradient is smooth and intuitive
- Current/neighbor triangles clearly distinct from active
- Emissive glow visible on all triangle types
- Earth sphere properly dark blue underneath
