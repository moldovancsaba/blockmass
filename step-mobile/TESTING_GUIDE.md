# Phase 2.5 Foundation - Testing Guide

**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-10T20:00:00.000Z  
**Status:** Ready for Device Testing

---

## üéØ What We're Testing

This guide covers testing the Phase 2.5 foundation implementation, which includes:
- ‚úÖ ProofPayloadV2 submission
- ‚úÖ Confidence score display (0-100)
- ‚úÖ Device metadata collection
- ‚úÖ Partial cell tower data (MCC/MNC)
- ‚úÖ Mock attestation tokens
- ‚úÖ Enhanced mining alerts with security feedback

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Backend API (Optional for Testing)
The app can work with or without the backend:

**Option A: Local Backend** (for full testing)
```bash
# In a separate terminal
cd /Users/moldovancsaba/Projects/blockmass/step-blockchain
npm run dev
```
Backend will run on: http://localhost:5500

**Option B: Production Backend** (already configured)
The app is configured to use: https://step-blockchain-api.onrender.com

**Option C: Mock Data** (no backend needed)
The app has built-in fallbacks for development testing.

### 2. Mobile App
The Expo server is already running on port 8000!

---

## üì± Testing on iPhone

### Step 1: Open Expo Go App
1. Open **Expo Go** app on your iPhone
2. Make sure your iPhone is on the same WiFi network as your Mac
3. Scan the QR code from the terminal (or Metro bundler screen)

**Alternative: Manual Connection**
If QR code doesn't work:
1. In Expo Go, tap "Enter URL manually"
2. Enter: `exp://192.168.100.138:8000` (your Mac's local IP)

### Step 2: Wait for App to Load
You should see:
- Loading screen
- Location permission request
- 3D Earth sphere visualization

### Step 3: Grant Permissions
1. **Location Permission**: Tap "Allow While Using App"
2. Wait for GPS to acquire lock (¬±5-50m accuracy)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: App Won't Load
**Solution:**
1. Check Expo Go is latest version
2. Restart Expo dev server: `npm start`
3. Clear cache: `npm start -- --clear`

### Issue: Location Permission Denied
**Solution:**
1. Go to iPhone Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services
2. Find your app > Enable "While Using the App"

### Issue: "Backend not responding"
**Solution:**
This is normal! The app has fallbacks:
- Uses mock triangle data
- Uses production API (https://step-blockchain-api.onrender.com)
- Development mode confidence scoring still works

### Issue: Confidence Score is 0
**Solution:**
Check logs for specific errors:
- Signature failed: Wallet issue
- GPS accuracy too low: Move to open area
- All zeros: Backend might be rejecting proof

### Issue: Cell Tower Data is Undefined
**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're on cellular network (not WiFi only)
- Some devices/carriers don't expose MCC/MNC
- This is expected and normal - partial support

### Issue: FPS is Low (<30)
**Solutions:**
- Close other apps
- Restart the app
- Check if device is overheating
- Try reducing triangle count (backend setting)
